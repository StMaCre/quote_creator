# Proposal Creator
You will find here my Proposal creator which is my final project for CS50. 
The aim of this work was to create a system that retrieves the price and name of a product after inserting the code linked to that item. 
This makes it easier to create a quote as it avoids having to search for the product in a large list. 

To create this I used Python, SQL and Flask. 

The project is thoroughly explained in the PPT that I attached to the repository.
